/* 
LOGIC: The string is generated by saying n copies of alphabet and find the x th term in it.
So, n=2 means AABBCCDDEE.... and so on. And we need to find the xth term
So, we start by buildign the required array much like we do in counting sort decreasing the repeat times
also take care that x is idexed 1 and not 0.
