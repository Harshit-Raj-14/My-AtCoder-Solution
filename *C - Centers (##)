UNDERSTANDING THE QUESTION
The question talks about a sequenc eof length 3n and so each number in it repeats 3 times.
f(i) is the representation of the index of the middle occurnece of a number in the sequence.
eg : 1 1 3 2 3 2 2 3 1
Note the ans is baed on 1 indexed.
the middle occurence of 1 in above sequence is 2.
as for 2 is 6 and for 3 is 5.
no. -> f(i)
1 -> 2
2 -> 6
3 -> 5
f(1)<f(3)<f(2), so 1,3, and 2 should be printed in this order.
So, based on ascending order -> 1,3,2 ==> o/p
