        int b=sc.nextInt();

        int arr[][]=new int[r][c];
        Solution(arr,a,b);

// LOGIC: The grid numbers can be considered addresses of that grid (r,c); see the explained example
condition of sharing sides with another sqaure : ∣a−c∣+∣b−d∣=1  So, a,b is given and c,d are going to be our variables. it is given in the question itself. 
you can remember it as well like a side will be shared when diffenece in abscissa and ordinate equals one.
Thing to note form the example is that a and b starts from 1 index and not 0.
so manage it in the question for i and j loops.
